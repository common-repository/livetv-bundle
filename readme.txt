For css bug or adaptative Work view FAQ 

* http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/livetv-bundle/faq/


Why I seperated twitch/justin ? 

* During this development, people in Gamers circle says on some channels in test, justin could have its dedicated Api soon because Justin has more ressource servers. If it is the fact, the code is ready.


Compatibility with frontend profil from connexion plugin


* Currently option "themed-profil" from theme-my-login not supported. If you desire to use the plugin with theme-my-login, themed-profil option must be disable from tab options of theme-my-login. If you have a adaptative solution, I need that.


== Installation ==

* Upload 'livetv-bundle' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
* To activated some parts, its very simple: You may use the part liveTV 2 ? Activate all sub-parts is required ( 0 + 1 ) + 2. View your dashboard plugins section and read each description for more information
* Define attributs and selector on pages options if the default registered options not be suitable for your theme.
* After the first run, maybe you have a blank page, leave the cron schedule worked and after some minutes the cache is generate

= Api extends =


Now a dedicated folder exists to make your own extension or for loads your personal css/JQuery file

View exemple in /extends/extend.php and its `/**comments**/`. 

The folder and its php files are automaticaly listed and parsed by the plugin. 

Just create your own personal php file (view exemple in `/extends/` for more basics informations and make your first hook).

you may enqueue your script or your style and maybe before dequeue original css/script

dequeue the original style: http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_dequeue_style

dequeue some original script: http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_dequeue_script


= Fix css "large view" =


A message for developer for the 'Large view'. 

Currently, the best solution I have found to cheat on one maximum of themes and display a 'Large view' it is a simple css cheating.

This cheating is loaded on request 'large view' and stop the display of the sidebar and enlarge the `<div id='content'>`.

This cheating is in a light css file `/css/page-livetreams-hook.css`

If your class or ID of `<div main content>` and `<ul widgets list>` from your current theme have a exotic class for this div/ul, maybe your large view have a css bug.

Replace the content of this css file with the good class/ID from your theme for this div/ul

e.g.

`
@charset utf-8;

.themename-sidebar{ /* change .themename-sidebar by the good ID/Class of your sidebar container */
    display:none!important;
    overflow:hidden!important
}

.themename-content { /* change .themename-content by the good ID/Class of your content container */
    width:100%!important;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 0;
}

#full-view-switcher {
    width:100%!important;
}
`

I look at the core of wordpress for a php function for the futur and I will added this function in a newest version for unset really the sidebar without css cheating for 'Large view'. Or enventually, a add_class function.


= To change the style of the widget with your own style =

I have added some class/ID for the span of informations @ the right side of each thumbnail (when channel is offline, and also when channel is online).

The class start with `w-*`

You may create a simple css load for the widget only when the page isn't your_livestream_page. A simple wordpress function is 

`
if(!is_page('your-livestream-page-ID')){
  wp_enqueue_style('your-personal-style-for-the-livestream-widget');
}
`

If you are a JQuery developer/passionate, to manipulate this class/ID/css, you may enqueue your script in the same way and maybe before dequeue original css/script 

dequeue the original style: http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_dequeue_style

dequeue some original script: http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_dequeue_script

`
if(!is_page('your-livestream-page-ID')){
  wp_enqueue_script('your-personal-script-for-the-livestream-widget');
}
`

You may personnalize also the widget only for the home page with is_home function

`
if(is_home()){
  wp_enqueue_style('another-personal-style-for-the-livestream-widget');
}
`

The same way for your JQuery script

`
if(is_home()){
  wp_enqueue_script('another-personal-script-for-the-livestream-widget');
}
`

= Tip dialog effect bug for some themes = 


I think maybe you have 2 load of q-tip (1.x version or adaptative work of this kind) loaded by your theme and eventually JQuery loaded by your theme from external static repository (Google). It is possible the problem comes from something like that: JQuery loaded 2 times or eventually q-tip css loaded 2 times or 2 different versions of q-tip.js loaded or eventually q-tip.js loaded 2 times. The plugin use the q-tip 2.0 version and the latest JQuery version included by wordpress (this plugin was developed under wordpress 3.3.2 version).

You may try to change one from theme or one from plugin. To changes the loading from the plugin, the good file is the file `plugin-livetv-display-lives.php` (to change or stop the load of JQuery or stop the original css q-tip file). but after some adaptative work is necessary. You may try also to stop the external load of JQuery from your theme (in your header.php file) and see if your theme made a bug for slider or other dependancies of JQuery from your theme.

If you decide to change the tip 'class' for dialog effect from the plugin and made some adaptative work (with the same class from your "q-tip" theme), is in the file `/page-frontend/page-livestreams.php` (just make a search on 'bubble').
